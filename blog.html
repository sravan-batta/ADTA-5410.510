        <h2>Topic 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with R</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical phase in data analysis that involves summarizing the
                main characteristics of a dataset. In this blog post, we'll walk through the process of EDA using R,
                focusing on data visualization.
            </p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Let's consider a hypothetical scenario where we have a dataset containing information about customer
                purchases, and we want to understand the distribution of purchase amounts.
            </p>

            <h3>Thought Process</h3>
            <p>
                Before diving into code, it's essential to define our goals. In this case, we aim to visualize the
                distribution of purchase amounts to identify any patterns or outliers that may require further
                investigation.
            </p>

            </p>

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>
                The generated histogram will provide insights into the distribution of purchase amounts. Analyzing the
                histogram, we can identify common purchase amounts and spot any anomalies or unexpected patterns.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                EDA is a powerful tool for gaining a preliminary understanding of your data. By combining visualization
                techniques with thoughtful analysis, you can uncover valuable insights that guide further steps in your
                data analysis journey.

        <h2>Topic 2: Linear Regression in R</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                Linear Regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and
                one or more independent variables. In this blog post, we'll explore the concept of Linear Regression
                using R and visualize the results.
            </p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Imagine you have a dataset containing information about the hours students spend studying and their
                exam scores. The problem is to understand the relationship between study hours and exam scores and
                predict scores based on study hours.
            </p>

            <h3>Thought Process</h3>
            <p>
                Before delving into code, it's crucial to define our goals. We want to determine if there's a linear
                relationship between study hours and exam scores. Linear Regression is a suitable method for this
                type of analysis.
            </p>

                <img src="Linear_Regression.png" alt="Linear Regression Plot">
            </p>

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>
                The scatter plot with the linear regression line provides a visual representation of the relationship
                between study hours and exam scores. The slope and intercept of the line can be used to make
                predictions.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Linear Regression is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting relationships between
                variables. By interpreting the results of the regression analysis, we can make informed decisions
                and predictions based on data.
